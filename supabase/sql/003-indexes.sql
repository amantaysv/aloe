-- Indexes for the queries the application actually runs.
--
-- Before this, the only index in the whole schema was products_name_trgm_idx. Foreign keys do not
-- get one automatically in Postgres, so products.category_id and products.brand_id were unindexed
-- too — which also makes every DELETE or UPDATE on categories/brands scan products.
--
-- Honest framing: at 3155 products and 18 orders none of this is currently a bottleneck; a
-- sequential scan over that is single-digit milliseconds. This is headroom for growth and it
-- removes the scans behind category/brand maintenance. Purely additive.
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor. Plain CREATE INDEX rather than CONCURRENTLY: the editor wraps
-- statements in a transaction, where CONCURRENTLY is rejected, and at this table size the build
-- holds the write lock for milliseconds.

-- Storefront listings. Partial on `published` keeps them small, since every public query filters
-- on it and nothing public ever reads unpublished rows.
